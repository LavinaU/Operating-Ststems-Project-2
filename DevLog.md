# Development Log

### Thoughts
Starting Project 2 for Operating Systems Concepts, on paper. I started working on it a bit ago, but figured I would refine version control later, and then realized that kind of defeats its purpose. oops. I am starting properly now! I think I will initialize git today, create this devlog, obviously, and then commit the skeleton setup. 

### My Plan
- Initialize Git
- Create devlog.md
- Commit initial setup

### Thoughts
I got an important call before I could carry out my simple plan yesterday evening! Properly commiting my plan from yesterday today, including this dev log. I just created the repo yesterday and made the read me file. 

### My Plan
- Initialize Git
- actually commit devlog.md
- Commit initial setup

### Thoughts
I ran into a huge issue with IntelliJ yesterday evening, which was of my own doing. I had forgotten to create and label an src folder, so the project root was all messed up, and then troubleshooting this was really annoying especially on top of other schoolwork I had, so I decided to build it all into one BankSimulation.java file that I used OnlineGDB to test/create. It wasn't particularly difficult to do so due to my previous first draft work on this project, and I do prefer having separate Teller and Customer files for clarity, so I will first try and revert to my previous version and work those in, or if I find trouble with that then I will simply test and commit in small pieces the onlineGDB file I was working on.

### My Plan
- resolve sourcfe file issue
- if it doesn't work, testing my OnlineGDB sidequest in small bites and committing it
