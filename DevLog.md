# Development Log

### Thoughts
Starting Project 2 for Operating Systems Concepts, on paper. I started working on it a bit ago, but figured I would refine version control later, and then realized that kind of defeats its purpose. oops. I am starting properly now! I think I will initialize git today, create this devlog, obviously, and then commit the skeleton setup. 

### My Plan
- Initialize Git
- Create devlog.md
- Commit initial setup

### Thoughts
I got an important call before I could carry out my simple plan yesterday evening! Properly commiting my plan from yesterday today, including this dev log. I just created the repo yesterday and made the read me file. 

### My Plan
- Initialize Git
- actually commit devlog.md
- Commit initial setup
